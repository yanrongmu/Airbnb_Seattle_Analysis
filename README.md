## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code requires the following basic libraries:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data from 2016 to better understand:

1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
2. where are the most expensive place in Seattle?
3. What are the most correlated factors that could affect the price?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to show the data understanding, preparation, analysis and evaluation related to the above questions. There are also necessary markdown cells and comments to help understanding the whole process and individual steps.

The datasets used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@owenihelen/where-to-stay-for-next-trip-to-seattle-8a6525b655a6).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
